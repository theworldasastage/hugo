By pairs. Player A tells a story to player B. Player B can only answer _No_. Then player B can only answer _Yes, But..._, then _Yes_ and finally _Yes, and_.

A good exercise to feel how we are affected by others' reaction to our ideas.

<!--more-->

- __Group size :__ By pairs
- __Time__ : 10-15 minutes

### Process
- Put the participants by pairs
- Show an example with a participant. You start a story and this participant can only answer _No_.
- Ask the participants to do the same by Pair. 
- After some time, ask them to switch.
- Debrief this first session with the _No_.
- Do the same with the next answers : _Yes, but..._, _Yes_, _Yes And_
- Debrief the whole exercice.

For example : 

> - A: Let's go to the beach!
> - B: No
> - A: So let's go to the mountain!
> - B: No

Another one : 

> - A: Let's go to the beach!
> - B: Yes, but I can't swim
> - A: So let's just take the sun!
> - B: Yes, but it gives cancer

### Remarks
Let the stories continue some time before switching A and B. It's part of the exercice to feel how hard it is to continue with some answers.


### Debrief questions
Between each answers : 

- How does it feel to have only this as an answer?
- How does it feel to start your sentences this way?
- Which was the more difficult, to answer or to build the story?

At the end : 

- Which answer did you prefer? In which role? Why?
- What are the link you see with the work.

### Comments
As caricatural this exercise may sound, it's a very efficient way to see how negative answers can be exhaustive.

It's also interesting to see that with most groups, a _Yes_ alone feel less good than a _Yes, but.._. An interpretation is that to say _Yes, but..._ you have to not only listen (_Yes_) but also to understand and build an answer connected (_but_). So you need to be more involved than a simple _Yes_.

This exercise is also a good way to show how story can go farther when we build positively on them (_Yes, and_).
