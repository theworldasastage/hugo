Player A offers an imaginary present to player B. Player B defines what is the present and show his happiness on what he has just been offered! The pair continues the same action back and forth.

This game is very simple and very good to show how hard it can be to define what should be the easiest thing : a present we would like.

- __Group size :__ By pairs
- __Time__ : 10-15 minutes

### Process
- Put the participants by pairs
- A presents B with an imaginary gift. A must offer the present so that B can see the shape of the present (is it big? is it squared, etc.).
- B accepts with joy the present by defining it : "Oh! It's a ...! Thank you!"
- Then B gives a present to A and so on.

### Remarks
If A is offering the present, it's very important that it's B and not A that should define the present.

A can offer very precise items or just a shape and let B define what is or what is inside this shape.

The participants should accepts the offer enthusiastically, it's part of this exercice to accept any offer with the most positive attitude. You may advice the participant to start accepting the offer with joy and manipulating it even before they brain decided what it is.

The players should exchange more than 3 presents each to evacuate the first easy ideas they had in mind and become more spontaneous. You should encourage them to go fast. 


### Debrief questions

- How did it feel to recieve gifts? And to give them?
- What did you think of having to identify the gift?
- How did it feel when the gift was identified as something else than what you offered?
- How does this relate to your work?

### Comments

I love this game because we ask a simple task : to define and be happy of a present we pick. Most of the time when we struggle finding ideas we thinj of a lot of exterior reasons : someone will juge us, we'll look stupid, etc.

Here the only juge is us and we realize how many stress we put on ourself. Why not just accepting the very good beer we are offering and looking for an unexpected present we won't be that happy with?

Offering a present is also an interesting experience since it's supposed to be an easy task. After all we just need to mime the offering of a present we don't need to define. But we struggle the same :  we don't want to offer the same shape, we want to define what is the present we are offering, etc.

And finally you can also play this game in full connexion with the other person and make it playful and beautiful. What if this present was not only a good present but a good present that only your partner could have think of?
