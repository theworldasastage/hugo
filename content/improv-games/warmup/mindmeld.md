In a group, a first player says _1_ when he thinks of a word. Then when a second player thinks he knows the word of the first player, he says _2_. Finally, together they say _1,2,3_ and their world. If they have the same word, it's a Mind Meld!

An excellent warmup to put a group in the same energy.

- __Group size :__ From 4 people.
- __Time__ : 5-10 minutes

### Process

Not a lot to precise, describe the game and start it.
When there is a _Mind Meld_, the players must dance and sing : 

> It's a mind meld! It's a mind meld! It happens all the time, it's a mind meld!

### Remarks
The description of the game may sound impossible, but by playing it, improvisers discover that each new word is a cue to find the next word association.
