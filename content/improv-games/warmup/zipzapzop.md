In a circle participants pass a _Zip!_ noise to each other. One player can decide to say _Zap!_ to change the direction of the noise or to say _Zop!_ to skip the next player.

This game is perfect to make every member of the group present.

- __Group size :__ From 4 people.
- __Time__ : 10 minutes

### Process

- Ask the participants to form a circle.
- Start by showing : say _Zip!_ and do a hand gesture to "give the noise" to the player on your right. If he doesn't follow naturally explain to repeat and pass to his right neighbour.
- After two turn in the same direction, introduce _Zap!_ with the gesture of crossing your arms. When a player recieve a _Zap!_ on his _Zip!_, the sense of transmission change, he needs to pass the _Zip!_ to the other direction.
- After some time with _Zap!_ and _Zip!_, introduce finally the _Zop!_ : when a player says _Zop!_, he needs to put his two hands as if he was wearing googles. The player next to him is skipped and the game continue in the same direction.

### Remarks
As the game become more easy for participants, ask to go faster. And also to take more risks.

After some time, we can introduce new rules (without describing them, just by showing) and some player should repeat the same thing.
