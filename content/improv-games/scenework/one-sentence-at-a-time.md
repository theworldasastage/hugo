Two players do a scene. They must say one sentence at a time : Player A starts with a sentence, Player B answer with another sentence, and so on.

A good setup to do scene where we concentrate on the listening between players.

- __Time__ : 30 minutes

### Process
The two players are doing a normal scene. Each player must say one sentence only and then listen to the answer by the other player.


### Remarks
This setup help to analyse what is happening and how each players listen to each other. By saying one sentence at a time, you can discuss if each sentence is connected to the previous one and not blocking.


Keith Johnstone in Impro for Storytellers presents a serie of way players are killing stories. This exercice is perfect to notice them and discuss with the group. Here are some of these blocking methods : 

- Blocking : a direct negation to the offer
- Wimping : Accepting the ideas but don't adding anything on them
- Cancelling : demanteling what has been established
- Gossiping : Avoiding interaction by discussing something that happen outside of the scene, arguing on a price, etc.
- Agreed activities : Doing exactly what the other player ask you to do, killing all interaction that can exists between players.
- Sidetracking : Adding elements to avoid the actual story
- Being original 
- Looping 
- Gagging 
- Lowering the stakes
