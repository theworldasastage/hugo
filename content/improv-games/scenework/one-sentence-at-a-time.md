Two players do a scene. They must say one sentence at a time: Player A starts with a sentence, Player B answer with another sentence, and so on.

A good setup to do a scene where we concentrate on the listening between players.

- __Group size :__ 2+
- __Time__ : 30 minutes

### Process
The two players are doing a normal scene. Each player must say one sentence only and then listen to the answer by the other player.


### Remarks
This setup helps to analyze what is happening and how each player listens to each other. By saying one sentence at a time, you can discuss if each sentence is connected to the previous one and not blocking.


Keith Johnstone in _Impro for Storytellers_ presents a series of way players are killing stories. This exercise is perfect to notice them and discuss with the group. Here are some of these blocking methods : 

- Blocking: a direct negation to the offer
- Wimping: Accepting the ideas but don't add anything on them
- Canceling: dismantling what has been established
- Gossiping: Avoiding interaction by discussing something that happens outside of the scene, arguing on a price, etc.
- Agreed activities: Doing exactly what the other player asks you to do, killing all interaction that can exist between players.
- Sidetracking: Adding elements to avoid the actual story
- Being original 
- Looping 
- Gagging 
- Lowering the stakes
