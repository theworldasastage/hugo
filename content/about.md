Hi there and welcome!

I am Baptiste Coulange and I am the founder and the remote Chief Technology Officer of [Cornis](http://web.cornis.fr/en/pages/home), a company using machine learning and data processing to make wind turbines inspections more efficient. Under the stage name Nicolas Tup√©gabet (I love anagrams) I'm a podcaster on the weekly french popular science podcast [Podcast Science](http://podcastscience.fm). And I'm improvising the rest of the time in workshops or with the [Barcelona Improv Group community](https://www.barcelonaimprovgroup.com/).
