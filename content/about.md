I'm Baptiste Coulange, co-founder and CTO of [Cornis](http://cornis.fr) now part of SITES group. we apply machine learning and data processing to make infrastructure inspections more efficient. I've podcasted a lot on the weekly French popular science podcast [Podcast Science](http://podcastscience.fm) created in 2010. I started improvisation sometimes around 2008 and I can't stop improvising since then.
