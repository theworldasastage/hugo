In front of this computer since hours I'm looking for how to start this article. How the find _the idea_ that will make it meaningful. I turn the music on and the distraction off and start to look around me to think [outside the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box). Two hours ago I planed to write this article about my first improvisation training. I've decided to train us on behavior and creativity topics. This first training is about what I'm struggling with now and what expressed one day one of my employee,

> How can I have more ideas?

<!--more-->

That's exactly the topic of this training, _why don't we have more ideas_ and how to train to make it more easy. At this point you must ask how someone with exactly the same problems will have any help. First, because building the story in the moment is what I do in theater improvisation. Next, because thanks to improvisation, I know that this first feeling is normal and can happen, you can't be a full time creative/productive genius.

I use regularly [applied improv](/team-collaboration-is-hard-improvisation-training-can-help/) to train my team on behavioral and creativity topics. You can find all the trainings [here](/tags/training/) if you are looking for resources.

# Introduction

When I present this kind of trainings to non-improvisers, I first precise what is the topic and the objective to it. The objective of this first training is to : __Feel and understand why we block ideas__ and __Train to act on it, to be more spontaneous__.

This training lasted 2H with a group of 5 people.

I organise this workshop in different parts that I will present below.

- Before : A form to have my team start thinking of the topic
- A brief introduction of the training and the objective
- A warm-up : As in sport we need to warm-up our bodies and minds
- Short Games : Theater use games to explore topics, these games are good to work on a particular subject.
- Scenes : Using what we learned during the games, we practice in some short scenes.
- What's next : At the end we decide what to apply in our work

> The most important part of Short Games and Scenes are the debrief. Contrary to usual learning, in improv and when you learn about your behaviour it's by debriefing as a group on what just happened that you can discover what are your reflexes and actions that you want to be more aware of.

Here are what and how we did all these events.

## Some first questions

One week before the start of the training, I sent to every participants 4 simple questions : 

- What is spontaneity for you?
- How spontaneity is linked with your work?
- Why aren't we spontaneous?
- When is the last time you didn't share one of your ideas with your team? What did you feel? Why didn't you share it?

These questions have a double objective. First they will help you to adapt the rest of the training to the people coming. But must importantly, they help to make the people coming start thinking of the topic. So don't expect to have everyone's answer, it's a cold warm-up.

### Answers

Each time I had to answer these questions or ask them, the answers came very similar. Yours will of course have some differences showing the culture of the group you'll work with.

__What is spontaneity?__

Spontaneity is seen as very _positive_ in our mind. We link it with _honesty_, _transparency_, _authenticity_, _emotion_, etc. These are all very important topics in our daily life that as unsurprisingly hidden in business world because they are also linked with _vulnerability_.

> Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path. 
> <small>Brown, Bren√©. Daring Greatly</small>

__How spontaneity is linked with work??__

But if you ask your people what spontaneity can bring to their work, they directly can see the link with innovation. _It's a way to react faster and better_, _to find new ideas_ and to _use the different point of views_.

__Why aren't we spontaneous?__

Some reasons of preventing spontaneity are clear in our mind : 

- _we are polite_
- _we juge ourselves_ : _it's too late_, _it's not original enough_
- _we are scared_ : _we don't want to look stupid_, _we don't want to say something wrong_, _we don't want to be juged_

> All these answers point the same elements, we don't share ideas as a protective behavior against others. 

## Presentation of the training

I try to make the introduction on the topic short but it's important to be clear on what we will work and how will be done the work.

As an internal member of the team, I first state the most important : we are working on being a better group, on improving our behavior together. So there is no one, even me as the trainer, who is _better_. 

> When you work on improving a group, it makes no sense that one person is better than the others.

Next, I remind them that human behaviors can be a tricky topic as it's link on how, as people, we act and react with other person. So, even trying to do my best to make this training useful and safe, I'll make mistakes.

> I play low status, and I'll explain that if the students fail they're to blame me. Then they laugh, and relax, and I explain that really it's obvious that they should blame me, since I'm supposed to be the expert; and if I give them the wrong material, they'll fail; and if I give them the right material, then they'll succeed.
> <small>Keith Johnstone</small>

Finally, I state back the topic : _today the work is on spontaneity_. And I tell them that they will have notes and resources about this training (this article) available after the training.

## Warm-ups / 15 min

Warm-up exercices are usualy safe games where the participants can warm their body and escape their mind from their work or worries to be fully present on the training.

## Exercises / 30 min

When the energy is there, I start the training with two games on our topic.

{{% improv-game "/improv-games/exercises/presents" %}}

This exercice is a perfect way to feel all the block we can put when we try to generate ideas. In this game the only rule about the ideas to generate is to make you happy. A good present can be a postcard, a glass of beer or a good book but we prefer to find good reasons to avoid these obcious ideas.

> I learned that the first idea was unsatisfactory because it was (1) psychotic; (2) obscene; (3) unoriginal. The truth is that the best ideas are often psychotic, obscene and unoriginal.
> <small>Keith Johnstone, Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</small>

The best way to let these ideas come is to _defer the jugement_. For example by being enthusiast even before deciding what is the present.

{{% improv-game "/improv-games/exercises/no-yesbut-yes-yesand" %}}

With this second exercise, players can experience that idea block can also come from our reactions. We usualy think that accepting ideas (_Yes_) is positive enough but to premit to a new idea to exist, we need to accept (_Yes_) and to buid on it (_Yes, and_).

## Scenework /30 min

{{% improv-game "/improv-games/scenework/one-sentence-at-a-time" %}}

This scenework is a way to see all what we discussed during the exercices in a concrete example. It's the occasion to point some reflex that we have all and that can prevent ideas to appear and be developed.

Each scene must be discussed with the group :
- What are the reaction of the player we observed?
- How did that affect the story? Was it a pleasant story?
- What are the link with your work?

During these scenes, the players will show some reflexes they have on their way to communicate. One of the objective of this training is to help each one of us to be aware of these mechanism and of the ones of others. 

## What's next! / 30min

The end of the training consist on a discussion on what we can get of these two hours : 

- What do we all remember of this work? 
- What did we learn?
- What are the link with our work?
- What will you change in your behavior?

Finally, to close this training, the group decide together what they will do in the next weeks as a conclusion of this training. Some examples : 

- Saying _Yes, and..._ at least once a day
- Make a noise when they hear a _Yes, but..._
