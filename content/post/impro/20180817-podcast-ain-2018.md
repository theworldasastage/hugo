From August 23rd and 26th 2018, Paris is hosting the [Applied Improvisation Network conference](http://appliedimprovisation.network).

> "Applied Improvisation" consists of using theatre improvisation outside of the theatre space to foster the development of teams, to improve communication and to teach the multiple skills in improv (creativity, listening, etc.).

The [Applied Improvisation Network](http://appliedimprovisation.network) is a community of more than 5000 members online. This conference is a platform for improvisers applying their passion in various fields to share how to bring the improv mindset off the stage.

[I am a podcaster](http://podcastscience.fm) and I will be recording the attendees' answers to the following two questions.  You can listen to the latest recordings below.

Here are the questions.

> **When did you discover applied improvisation?**

> **What example of applied improvisation are you the most proud of?**


I'm sure the conference attendees have exciting stories to share about their experiences. Perhaps we'll have a chance to meet at the conference. If not, please share your answers to the questions in the comments below.
