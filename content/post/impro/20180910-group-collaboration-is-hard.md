> When is the last time you left a meeting frustrated? 

My last time was the previous meeting before you read this post. We are all working together on the same project, but it's always the same : 

- he can't stop talking and to let any space to others
- she always criticizes the new ideas on detail before even we could build on it
- he brings to the meeting topics that had nothing to do with the initial agenda
- she can't stop making stupid jokes
- he doesn't understand the big picture
- she is obsessed with her pointless ideas
- etc.

Meetings are _improvised group collaboration_: In large part, nobody knows before the meeting how he will contribute, and his actions and reactions depend on others behaviors and sayings.

We improvise collaboration with other human beings all the time. In our couple, at any shop, in associations, with our family, etc. So we take it for granted. After all, this is the activity we've dedicated the most time of our life, we should be an expert.

__I think that improvised group collaboration is one of the most difficult human activity I have to do.__ As a consequence, instead of considering myself as an expert not needing much work on it, I now stay [humble and demanding](/humble-and-demanding/).

_Humble_ because, as most of the people, I've never really _worked_ on it other than by direct random experimentation. So, as for any activity I have to be humble and eager to learn how to be better at it.

_Demanding_ because it's possible to improve it and make a group collaborate in a way more efficient way than the sum of its parts.

## When a group shines

The last time I've seen a group collaborating together so effectively you couldn't believe it was not scripted is in some good Improvisational Theater like the improvised musical show of [The Showstoppers](http://www.theshowstoppers.org/).

The Showstoppers are not coming on stage doing whatever they have in mind. They are here to do one thing : _create a musical that will entertain you, and that you will remember_. In this video they had the exact same problems of any of our meetings and thanks to their hard work, it _flows_, you hardly can notice any mistake, this is the result of their improvisation training.

The modern Improvisational theater is not new anymore, it had been first popularised by [Viola Spolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Spolin) and [Keith Johnstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Johnstone) books, and now thousands of people are practicing. Its techniques are used today outside of theater at the heart of innovation of the [MIT](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/02/18/improvisation.business.skills/index.html) and of companies like [Google, Facebook or Apple](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055380/why-top-companies-and-mba-programs-are-teaching-improv).

## What can we learn

> The techniques of the theater are the techniques of communicating
> <small>Viola Spolin in "Improvisation for the theater."</small>

Every time two human beings are communicating, there are theater techniques and games to improve it.

### Listening and Building

Each time I enter the stage first in an improvised play, I'm scared. When you start your scene, not knowing where is going the story, not knowing if your teammates and the audience will react well to your offer, you only want one thing: _not have entered in this stupid stage in the first place_.

Any person proposing a new idea is the same, the idea is still new and needs protection. Improvisers have created the mantra _yes, and_ to protect and build on these new ideas. The _yes, and_, is not only being nice on a proposition as kind people tend to do. It's about __being the best follower that has ever existed__, to make everything you can to make that idea work, to __make your partner look beautiful__. So, if it fails, _it won't be the mistake of anyone, it will be the learning of the everyone._

> Whether it's the kernel of a movie idea or a fledgling internship program, the new needs protection. Business-as-usual does not. Managers do not need to work hard to protect established ideas or ways of doing business. The system is tilted to favor the incumbent. The challenger needs support to find its footing. And protection of the new-of the future, not the past must be a conscious effort.

__Trust__
I was at the [2018 Applied Improvisation Network Conference in Paris](http://appliedimprovisation.network/events/2018-paris/). As we were discussing on how to enable a group on being better at problem-solving, a theater director shared his surprise :

> In theater it can take years of work for building trust in a group before we even start to solve problems.

A hard part of an improviser work is to build trust in a group. And this is firmly connected to how the group reacts to mistakes. Education systems everywhere in the world are formed by the same idea of giving feedback when we are wrong. We all have a grown on a culture of being ashamed of our mistakes. Improvisers learn to embrace them. 

Embracing mistakes is not only being ok with every error, but it's also making mistakes part of the process. Improvisers learn to have a positive reaction to errors, to make fun of it, to even build on it, so there is no more fear of taking a risk so that you can find new original solutions.

> One night I was operating lights for the show Theatersports. It was my first time in the booth and I was taking everything very seriously, making sure I knew the correct sequences and controls. I was terrified of making a mistake, destroying the show and letting everyone down. Keith came into the lighting booth, casually looking around, asking, "Is this your first time doing lights?"
> 
> "Yes." I replied
> 
> "Ah", he said. "You need to make at least 3 mistakes or you haven't done your job.
> 
> Then he left the booth.
> 
> For the whole show I was looking for any opportunity to take risks so that I could make my quota of mistakes. At the end of the show he said, "Patti, you made 2 mistakes  try again next time."
> 
> Keith used the logic of success to get me to make mistakes. He relieved me of the stress of fear of failure by giving me permission to make mistakes. He created an environment where I could take risk and learn.
> 
> <small>Patti Stiles in "The art of making mistakes."</small>

### Freedom and Constraints

When I ask friends to describe how they see improvisation they always tell me that _"it's the liberating activity of doing whatever you want on stage and make fun of it."_ If this were true, the Showstoppers show would be a mess.

When you go to an improv show, they ask you for a word, they describe the strict rules of their play, they can even ask you to define some precise elements of the drama. And if they don't, they certainly work together months to establish, between themselves, these constraintes. It's because improvisers also know that creation and collaboration are only possible under constraints. In a business environment, maintaining the equilibrium between freedom and constraints is difficult but indispensable.

> "The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the organization, must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader acts as an "Eyes-On, Hands-Off" enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem in which the organization operates." - Stanley McChrystal from the U.S. Forces Afghanistan in "Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World"

### Storytelling

> There are no gods, no nations, no money and no human rights, except in our collective imagination." 
> <small>Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</small>

The most obvious topic where theater can help the organizations is storytelling. The importance of storytelling in organizations is not a new idea, and a lot of books have theorized the way to build a compelling story. Even some events like TED conferences have mastered the codification to the point that it's always efficient... but tend to be boring as we all now see the pattern.

Storytelling is way more than telling a personal anecdote in the middle of a red circle. Improvisers work on building the story that this group, this audience, at this moment needs instead of following scripted tools.

## What comes next?

Learning with the tools of Improvisational theater is a journey. There is no shortcut because it's about being more self-aware of your habits and your surrounding. And then, you can decide, by yourself, the kind of human you want to be with others.

This is what this blog is about, sharing games and tool, to be a better human with others.

And if you can't wait for new articles, here are some resources.

__You are not yet convinced and want more examples?__ 

Check out the book [Applied Improvisation: Leading, Collaborating, and creating beyond the theater](https://www.amazon.fr/Applied-Improvisation-Leading-Collaborating-Creating/dp/1350014362/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536582058&sr=8-1&keywords=applied+improvisation) for a lot of examples of the application of theater techniques outside of the theater and their outstanding results.

__You are convinced, and you want to start using these tools?__

My best advice is to find some improv training or workshops near your home to discover the process of improv training. If you can't or prefer to read, you can check the fantastic book [Training to imagine](https://www.amazon.fr/Training-Imagine-Improvisational-Techniques-Creativity-ebook/dp/B015YFJ8GC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536582204&sr=8-1&keywords=training+to+imagine) to get a guided help on how to start applying improvisation in your organization.

__Too long, didn't read! Just watched the Showstoppers video, they are fantastic!__

This other video is for you. Here is an example of improv training that makes the Showstopper so amazing.
