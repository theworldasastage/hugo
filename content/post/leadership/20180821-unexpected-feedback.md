I recently read the small but excellent [Guide to One to One Meetings](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/announcing-a-guide-to-one-on-one-meetings-for-managers-and-employees-63d123a91db) by [Claire Lew](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/@clairejlew) from [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).

One of the _best question_ to ask according to the guide is about manager feedback : 

> Would you like more or less direction from me?

As managers, we crave feedback from our employees, and I never thought of asking the question directly. 

I use to ask for this kind of feedbacks in a team setting with [retrospectives] (https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective) or during one to one with more general questions like "What do you think of the Company?", "What would you like to change?". But I never before asked for direct feedback about _how I manage_ them.

I tried, and the answer was limpid :

> Oh, I've never thought about that! I'll think of it for our next one to one.

The option to have the individual feedback going this way was not self-evident, and this simple question opened the room for beginning it.

## Audience feedback

Improv workshops are organized around this idea of feedback. [Keith Johnstone](https://www.keithjohnstone.com/) in [Impro for storytellers](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Storytellers-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301054/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534784422&sr=8-1&keywords=impro+for+storytellers) talk about _being educated by the audience_ : 

> When I was young we thought that we should educate the audience, but I began to suspect that the audience should be educating us. 
> 
> - But, Keith, we have the knowledge! 
> - No, we don't! We're just guessing, but they know when to laugh, and when to be silent, and when to weep, and when to unwrap their chocolates. They may not be able to verbalize their knowledge, but they have it.
> 
> <small>Keith Johnstone - Impro for Storytellers (p. 31)</small>

I feel the same for feedback from my team. We're just guessing, but they know when they feel bad, when they are disengaged, when our management is inappropriate. _They may not be able to verbalize their knowledge but they have it._

## The two minds

There is one helpful Keith Johnstone game to illustrate this difference between what _we think we should do_ and _what the audience want _: "What comes next with a committee."

A committee of three or four players are in front of the audience, facing the stage, they are the directors of the scene, they decide what will come next.

An actor is playing what the committee decided, and when they don't know what to do, they ask "What comes next?" to the director and so on.

The audience is here to give direct feedback on the committee propositions, they make a noise, "ding," if they don't feel like the proposition and "ugh" if they don't like it.


> - Actor : What comes next?
> - Committee : You are walking in a Jungle
> <br/>_[Audience go Ding!]_
> - Actor (start walking) : What comes next?
> - Comittee : You discover a hidden temple
> <br/>_[Audience go Ding!]_
> - Actor : What comes next?
> - Comittee : An alien come out of the temple.
> <br/>_[Audience go Ugh!]_
> - Comittee : You enter the temple!
> - Actor (enters the temple) : What comes next?
> - etc.

This game brings some very unexpected and funny situations. First, most of the time, the audience is unanimous, all the audience know what is good or bad even if it's a spontaneous reaction. At some point, the committee is not able anymore to make an acceptable proposition for the audience. As if, becoming a director they lost all that they like as an audience! 

This committee is not aliens or different from the audience, but in the role of deciding what will happen, they become unaware of what should happen as if we had two minds that can't efficiently work together. This feedback question is like to be educated by the audience, _they know_.
