Every time I have a one-on-one, I have a single mission: to understand how the other person is feeling.

**Ask your employee to prepare the Agenda**

# TO REMEMBER
- Explain why you need their input.
- Talk less.
- Monitor the time you speak

## Catching up
> How is life?
> How were your vacations


## Concerns and issues
> Is anything holding you back from doing the best work you can do right now?

> When have you been frustrated in the past year? What can I do to help make things less frustrating for you, or get out of your way?

> What are you worried about right now?

> What are your biggest time wast- ers?

## Feedback
How can we work better together

> Would you like more or less feedback on your work? Why/why not?

> When have you been annoyed, peeved, or bothered by me and something Iâ€™ve done? What would be helpful for you for me to change my behavior going forward?


## Carreer direction
> If you could design your ideal role in a company, what would it look like?

> If you could be proud of one ac- complishment between now and next year, what would it be?
