> “how people do things around here.”

3 levels of culture : 
- Artifacts : things you can see, touch, smell.
- Espoused values and beliefs 
- Basic underlying asumptions :  Basic underlying assumptions are the things you actually believe.

> Changing your company culture is not about just changing the artifacts. Getting beer taps installed in the kitchens doesn’t make your culture more friendly. Nor does building an onsite gym mean your culture all of sudden cares about employees’ health and well-being.
