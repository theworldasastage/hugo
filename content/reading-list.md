> "How to live? A. Read a lot, forget most of what you read, and be slow-witted" - Sarah Bakewell

I'm always reading. I do it obviously because it's fun to discover and learn new things. But If I'm more honest, I read because in each book I discover a bit more about what we are all obsessed about : Why are we there? Each book bring its little insight on how to behave, how to learn, how to be more happy.

> "Reading a book is like re-writing it for yourself. You bring to a novel, anything you read, all your experience of the world. You bring your history and you read it in your own terms." - Angela Carter

Every time I go to someone home, the first thing I look at is his library. And the second thing I do is to ask his favorite book. _"You'll never stumble upon the unexpected if you stick only to the familiar"_ said Ed Catmull from Pixar. I discovered most of the books below. Without this random walk I would never have discover all these books about acting and relationships or this fiction using its own language to describe wind or even this statistics professor who use his mathematical skills to do magic. 

All these books had an impact on my life and define who I am today. As I continue to read, this list will continue to evolve. Pick a book and read it to the next one, this list will be waiting here for more recommandation if at one point you have no more reading ideas.

### Books that changed my world view

**[The last Fermat theorem](https://www.amazon.com/Fermats-Last-Theorem-Simon-Singh-ebook/dp/B009UKUGXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534581638&sr=8-1&keywords=the+last+fermat+theorem&dpID=51S2Yhsv5FL&preST=_SY445_QL70_&dpSrc=srch) by Simon Singh.** I have a strong scientific and mathematical background but I first encounter _popular science_ way later with this book. [Simon Singh](https://simonsingh.net/) is a famous british popular science author and this book, reading without any prior scientific knowledge, takes you in a mathematician mind. You'll discover that science is not this easy and linear path we usually read about but a path with a lot of mistakes and people crazy enough to think they can model the world. If you prefer read about the origin of the universe, his other book [Big Bang](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Universe-Simon-Singh/dp/0007162219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534582638&sr=8-1&keywords=big+bang+book&dpID=41UpqG%252BbX9L&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) is also a fantastic book.

**[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534582680&sr=8-1&keywords=impro) by Keith Johnstone.** [Keith Johnstone](https://www.keithjohnstone.com/) is one of the pionneer of improvisational theater and this book begins with a presentation of where he comes from to continue with improvisation core ideas. Improvisational theater is not only about playing on a stage in front of people. It's, as is theater, a neverending study of how we behave, how we interact, how we create. As so even if you don't plan on acting in your life, I highly recommend to read this book, you would be surprise how close improvisational idea are from your day to day experience.

> "Instead of seeing people as untalented, we can see them as phobic, and this completely changes the teacher’s relationship with them." - Keith Johnstone. 


**[Audition: Everything an Actor Needs to Know to Get the Part](https://www.amazon.com/Audition-Michael-Shurtleff/dp/0553272950/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534583051&sr=8-1&keywords=Audition%3A+Everything+an+Actor+Needs+to+Know+to+Get+the+Part) by Michael Shurtleff.** In a Keith Johnstone workshop, he recommended this book from the 80s by a Broadway casting director. As I was not planning on having a Broadway audition, I'm probably not the most obvious target for this book but I gave it a try. This is one of the best book about human relationship I've read and I now recommand everyone to read it. _"all the world's a stage"_ said Shakespeare and we all tend to act in every situation instead of just living the moment. This book go deep in this acting, on the multiple emotion mixed in our mind when we are having a simple conversation, on the love existing in every couple fight. All the books of this list are great but this is the one you probably think is not for you and where you'll find the most of insight on how you live and what motivates you.

> "A good play is a mirror of the way human beings behave. The actor's job is to provide what is underneath the behavior of human beings."- Michael Shurtleff 

**[Sapiens : A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534583533&sr=8-1&keywords=sapiens) by Yuval Noah Harari.** Hearing everyday bad news on TV makes hard to see the big picture on human history. This book makes the impossible, it really gives you _a brief history of humankind_. First it's mindblowing to follow the journey of humankind from the first humans to today's hyper-technological societies. The author also defend a thesis that all this history is only about storytelling. The human is this animal who invents fiction over fictions to cooperate. What is money? What are cities? What is science? All these concepts doesn't exist outside the mind of humans. This book made me realise how strong we believe in our stories.

> "How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined." - Yuval Noah Harari

**[Creativity Inc](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534584393&sr=8-1&keywords=creativity+inc) by Ed. Catmull.** As [my company](http://web.cornis.fr) grew, I became a manager responsible for the creativity and the productivity. The _beauty and the beast_, as Ed Catmull describes them, are hard to keep together. This book describes how [Pixar](https://www.pixar.com/), the great filmmaking company works and manage to stay creative with the number of movie they produce increasing and with huge technical constraint (they are making their own 3D engine). Where a lot of books about management are quite theorical, this one describe how they made it work, the hard moments and how being a good manager is not only what you do but also how you behave in any circonstances. I'm not sure I'm a good manager today but for sure this book influenced my management.

> "The past should be our teacher, not our master." - Ed Catmull


**[Remote: Office Not Required](https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534585605&sr=1-1&keywords=remote) by Jason Fried &  David Heinemeier Hansson.** As most of us I started by work life by commuting everyday to an office, staying in this office most of the day and commuting back to home to sleep. And as a lot of workers today, my work consist on sitting behind a computer and working on website hosted in countries allover the world. _Remote_ presents an alternative, what if you and your team put their computers where they wanted and worked as a distributed team thanks to the holy Internet. This is not an easy change but since this read I've modified my way of working and of interacting to people to make it remote-friendly. That's also for sure the most surprising aspect of remote working : all the good habits you _need_ to make remote work happen are also fantastic habit for traditional working. This book is very short, it's more a list of good quotes than a proper book but if you are not familiar with remote working, it should open your mind.

> "Letting people work remotely is about promoting quality of life, about getting access to the best people wherever they are" - Jason Fried &  David Heinemeier Hansson

**[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534586083&sr=8-1&keywords=Quiet%3A+The+Power+of+Introverts+in+a+World+That+Can%27t+Stop+Talking) by Susan Cain.** I read this book as an extravert trying to understand introverts around me and the more I read about introverts the more I discovered myself as one of them. Our today world is built around extraverts concepts like brainstorming, meetings, conferences. This book explore another facet of human behavior. And in some case like mine and maybe yours, how to accept a bit more what really sparks you joy.

> "What if you love knowledge for its own sake, not necessarily as a blueprint to action? What if you wish there were more, not fewer reflective types in the world?" - Susan Cain

**[The Art of Asking](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Asking-Learned-Worrying-People/dp/1455581097/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534586681&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+asking&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) by Amanda Palmer.** [Amanda Palmer](http://amandapalmer.net/) is a unique artist. She now makes everything for free and is paid by donations on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer), she is _asking_ for donation. This book is about her life but still reveal a lot about human relationships. How we don't dare to _ask_ something, how we think that _asking_ and _begging_ are synonims. By her way of living she also reveal how humans can be generous and not waiting for something in return. You may not want to read about an unknown artist but you can still listen her [music](http://amandapalmer.net/music/), read her [blog](http://blog.amandapalmer.net/), be surprised

> "all of us come from some place of wanting to be seen, understood, accepted, connected." - Amanda Palmer

Popular science books help you discover how much we know (and don't know) about our world. I can't spend a month without reading one!

**[We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe](https://www.amazon.com/We-Have-No-Idea-Universe/dp/0735211515/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534587223&sr=8-1&keywords=We+Have+No+Idea%3A+A+Guide+to+the+Unknown+Universe) by Jorge Cham & Daniel Whiteson.** If you think sciences knows everything, think again, this book presents a list of topic where science have no idea of what is happening.

I think the most interesting part of this book is [Kip Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne)  trying to see if the most exagerated effect of the movie would be possible with what we know of the universe. Unexpectedly a lot is possible and the lest realistic parts are probably not the one you think.
    
**[Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534587473&sr=8-3&keywords=why+we+sleep) by Matthew Walker.** This book detail what science can tell you about sleep and bad sleep.

### Management and Remote working

Becoming a team leader, I've started reading what others did to make their team work and I discovered a _genra_ full of fantastic books about group and human psychology.

**[Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility](https://www.amazon.com/Powerful-Building-Culture-Freedom-Responsibility/dp/1939714095/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534587871&sr=8-1&keywords=Powerful%3A+Building+a+Culture+of+Freedom+and+Responsibility) by Patty McCord.** Patty McCord tell how she built a high-performing culture at Netflix. Her ideas about management are fresh and grounded on experience. Even if you are probably not in a position in a company as big as Netflix, it's a good way to learn how to make a group work.


**[The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534588072&sr=8-1&keywords=a+year+without+pant) by Scott Berkun.** Most of new books about remote working are describing how great this new way of working is and few are the books giving an opposite voice, this is one of them. Scott Berkun tells his year at wordpress.com, a fully distributed company. His point of view is unique because he started the job not as a person who craved to work remote but more as someone who would have prefered a traditionnal way of working. As a consequence, he can share what impressed him, what worked well and of course some bad consequence of a remote working company.

**[Reinventing Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534588308&sr=8-1&keywords=Reinventing+Organizations) by Frederic Laloux.** This book starts with a history of company organisation stages. The book is worth reading only for this first chapter as you can discover that this good old business we see as unchanged has evolved a lot in the recent years. The second part of the book is about the future of organisation.

### Storytelling

Since I've read _Sapiens_, I tend to see stories everywhere and storytelling in the core of human behaviors. Books on storytelling can come from a lot of different people but they tend to present, each with a different point of view, the same ideas.

**[How to Improvise a Full-Length Play: The Art of Spontaneous Theater](https://www.amazon.com/How-Improvise-Full-Length-Play-Spontaneous/dp/1581154933/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534588692&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+improvise+a+full-length+play) by Kenn Adams.** As the title describes, this book presents how to improvise a full 1H play. To manage to achieve this goal, you need to understand what is a story, what make a good and a bad story, how to create strong relationships between characters, etc. These elements are not différent from when you want to communicate any idea. After all, as any creation, this approach tries to answer the question "Why should I care about your story?".

**[Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Play-Improvisation-Life-Art/dp/0874776317/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534588891&sr=8-3&keywords=Free+Play) by Stephen Nachmanovitch.** You need to read this book slowly, it's a journey. Each chapter explore one aspect of creation and the internal struggles any author can have. Between each page you'll think on your attitude towards the same questions, how you can make it evolve, it's a unique experience and you won't read the same book as anyone else.

### Fiction

I don't read a lot of fiction, probably because I like how life can be unexpected. But here are some books I loved to read.

> "Life is always going to be stranger than fiction, because fiction has to be convincing, and life doesn't" - Ayn Rand

**[Novecento](https://www.amazon.com/Novecento-Oberon-Modern-Allesandro-Barrico/dp/1849430381/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534589236&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=noveciento+barrico) by Allesandro Barrico.** Just have this 96 pages books always with you. If one day you have one hour to wait, read it, you won't regret it.

**[The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy/dp/0345453743/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534589371&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Ultimate+Hitchhiker%27s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy) by Douglas Adams.** The famous trilogy of five books by Douglas Adams. I'm not a hardcore fan of Science Fiction but I love the way Douglas Adams approach it. As an example, he won't create a complicated quantum-based explanation to describe an invisible ship. He will, with the _Someone Else Problem Field_ explain that this ship use the same technology as the one we have when we don't see socks on the floor : we don't see them because they are _someone else problem_.

> "The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain." - Douglas Adams.

**[Flowers for Algernon](https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Algernon-Daniel-Keyes/dp/015603008X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534589672&sr=8-1&keywords=Flowers+for+Algernon) by Daniel Keyes.** A retarded person writes a journal about his journey on an experiment to get a better IQ. As he gets more intelligent his behavior with other changes. It's a very sad story but a fantastic journey on the links between intelligence and emotion, about difference. If you give a chance to this book, it won't leave your mind.

{{< partial "mailing" "Subscribe to my newsletter to recieve one new book recommendation every week.">}}

### Historical fiction & biographies

My favorite genra is historical fiction and biographies. As I didn't like so much fiction I love to learn about real life stories.

**[Oil and Marble: A Novel of Leonardo and Michelangelo](https://www.amazon.com/Oil-Marble-Novel-Leonardo-Michelangelo/dp/1628729066/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534590177&sr=8-1&keywords=Oil+and+Marble%3A+A+Novel+of+Leonardo+and+Michelangelo) by Stephanie Storey.** While Leonardo was painting Mona Lisa to become the greatest painter in history, Michelangelo was making his David to become the greatest sculptor in history. This book is about this story, in the same moment, in the same place, of two genious living for their art.
    
**[To Be a Machine: Adventures Among Cyborgs, Utopians, Hackers, and the Futurists Solving the Modest Problem of Death](https://www.amazon.com/Be-Machine-Adventures-Utopians-Futurists/dp/110191159X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534590278&sr=8-1&keywords=To+Be+a+Machine%3A+Adventures+Among+Cyborgs%2C+Utopians%2C+Hackers%2C+and+the+Futurists+Solving+the+Modest+Problem+of+Death) by Mark O'Conell.** If you like Science Fiction what about reading about cutting edge science? This book is very disturbing. You will discover possible futures that you're not sure you want to live in and it will bring questions about what is life, what is human, what society we want.

**[Gratitude](https://www.amazon.com/Gratitude-Oliver-Sacks/dp/0451492935/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534590421&sr=8-3&keywords=Gratitude) by Oliver Sacks.** This book is a series of text written by Oliver Sacks between his last book and his death as he knew he was condamned. This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. The last thoughts of a great scientist full of gratitude some month before his last breaths will make you cry and smile.

> "When people die, they cannot be replaced. They leave holes that cannot be filled, for it is the fate the genetic and neural fate of every human being to be a unique individual, to find" - Oliver Sacks

There are enough recommandations for now, start with one of them and you won't stop!
