Here are some excellent articles I've read this week.

## Dataviz

An [interesting article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-animated-graphs-in-python-bb619cc2dec1) on how to make animated figures with Python. Not sure of the use case but good to know.

And since we are talking about figures, [another one](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-for-data-scientists-317c2723aa31) about how to make your figure storytelling better. I also [wrote an article on what informations to put in every figure captions](https://theworldasastage.com/the-5-informations-every-figure-caption-should-have/).

Finally I discovered an awesome JS library for graphs : [AnyCharts](https://www.anychart.com/). They have all kind of graphs, heatmaps, Gandt charts, etc.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is used a lot to classify but way less for other applications. [This article](https://hackernoon.com/key-point-detection-in-flower-images-using-deep-learning-66a06aadc765) presents an exemple of the use of deep learning to find keypoints on flower images.

[Deep Learning Studio](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-studio-got-an-update-i-especially-liked-feature-1-cf53555e794d?source=rss----7f60cf5620c9---4) is a visual tool to build neural networks, train them and test them.

## LOL

Here is the testimony of the person who invented autocorrect on the original iPhone : ["I Invented the Iphone's autocorrect. Sorry about that, and you're welcome"](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-i-invented-autocorrect/)
