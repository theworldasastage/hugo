Here are some excellent articles I read this week.

# Learn
## Code

A neverending question for a developer is _how to continue to learn with a full-time job?_. This [article](https://dev.to/beznet/learning-code-while-working-a-full-time-job-365p) tries to answer this question.

Some ideas are perfect are they are simple to start and beneficial like the [coding log](/dev/code-log/) where you journal every day about what you learn in code. And it's even better if this coding log is public since you can share with other your foundings, your questions, your practices.

## Data science

_Data science_ is a simple term that embodies a lot of different scientific activities. It's not always easy to know what you should know and are still not using. [This long article](https://towardsdatascience.com/essential-math-for-data-science-why-and-how-e88271367fbd) give a good list of math tools a data scientist should know how to use. 


Je pense que les deux sujets (avec des liens) particulièrement intéressant dans notre cas sont les statistiques et les mathématiques discrètes. Pour  Marc Chachuat Marc  et  Clément Boisson Clément  la partie optimisation peut aussi être intéressante (même si a mon avis vous avez déjà largement le niveau).

## Dataviz
Data visualization is storytelling. Unfortunately too many times, we don't think on the story we are transmitting when we create a data visualization. [Data to viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) is an incredible resource about how to do a data visualization and the common pitfalls to avoid. I highly recommend putting this one on your favorites. Here are 8 traps from the website as an example.

## Microservices culture
I think one of the most significant mind shift in dev is the generalization of microservices. And not only because it changes a lot of our coding habits but also because it needs to be accompanied by a team culture change. Rare are the articles talking about this subject, this [article](https://buttercms.com/books/microservices-for-startups/designing-a-successful-microservices-engineering-culture) is one of them.

As an example, to make microservices work, a team need : 

- Great communication and documentation
- Each team member must have more freedom and as a consequence more responsibility
- Taking the initiative, since services are now _micro_ you can and need to develop an initiative: mindset in your teams.

## You are what you code
I'm always surprised how some coders don't care that much on how their code looks like. I think as authors, part of you is in your code. When someone reads your code (and someone will) just by reading how you named your vars, he can make an opinion on how you think. So re-read yourself and here is a [Hackernoon article](https://hackernoon.com/the-art-of-naming-variables-52f44de00aad) on how to name these vars we use every day.

## Watercooler
This week I will be at the [Applied Improvisation Network Conference](http://appliedimprovisation.network/). Here is a definition of applied improv : 

> "Applied Improvisation" is the umbrella term widely used to denote the application of theatre improvisation (theories, tenets, games, techniques, and exercises) beyond conventional theatre spaces to foster the growth and/or development of flexible structures, new mindsets, and a range of inter- and intrapersonal skills required in today's VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world.
> <small>Theresa Robbins Dudeck. Applied Improvisation: Leading, Collaborating, and Creating Beyond the Theatre (p. 1). Bloomsbury Publishing.</small> 

I'll [record some interview there](http://theworldasastage.com/two-questions-at-the-applied-improvisation-network-conference/) of the participants so stay tuned if you want to learn more about it. Have you ever heard of that topic? Do you also use inspiration from some of your hobbies for your work?
