&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you left a meeting frustrated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last time was every meeting. We are all working together on the same project, but it&amp;rsquo;s always the same :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;he can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;she always criticizes the new ideas and about minute details before we can even start building on it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;he brings topics that had nothing to do with the initial agenda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;she can&amp;rsquo;t stop cracking stupid jokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the big picture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;she is obsessed with her pointless ideas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings are &lt;em&gt;improvised group collaboration&lt;/em&gt;: the participants don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know how they will contribute, and their reactions depend on others&amp;rsquo; behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We improvise collaboration with others all the time. In our relationship, in a store, at associations, with our family, etc. We take it for granted, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn how to interact with others. After all, this is the activity that we dedicate the most time to. By now, we should be experts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that improvised group collaboration is one of the most difficult human activity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of considering myself as an expert, I now try to stay &lt;a href=&#34;https://theworldasastage.com/humble-and-demanding/&#34;&gt;humble and demanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humble&lt;/em&gt; because, as most people, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really worked on &lt;em&gt;collaboration&lt;/em&gt; except in day to day interactions. So, as for any activity I have to be humble and eager to learn how to be better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demanding&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s possible to improve it and make a group collaborate in a much more efficient way than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-a-group-shines&#34;&gt;When a group shines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a group work together so effectively you couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it was not scripted was in the improvised musical show of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theshowstoppers.org/&#34;&gt;The Showstoppers&lt;/a&gt;. This video is long but just watch 30sec at the middle of the show to get an idea of what can improvise a group in front of an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LZWg2vi6GE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video you can hardly notice any mistake. But the Showstoppers are no different, they have the same problems we have in our meetings : unplanned and strange ideas, people insisting too much on what they have in mind, misunderstandings on what the story is about, etc. Their difference is that they trained to make their collaboration &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improv is a mission-driven, goal-directed team activity where each participant is, at various times, both a leader and a follower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Izzy Gesell&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern Improvisational theater is not new anymore, it has been first popularised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Spolin&#34;&gt;Viola Spolin&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Johnstone&#34;&gt;Keith Johnstone&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; books, and now thousands of people are practicing it. Its techniques are used today outside of theater at the heart of innovation at &lt;a href=&#34;http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/02/18/improvisation.business.skills/index.html&#34;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and at companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/3055380/why-top-companies-and-mba-programs-are-teaching-improv&#34;&gt;Google, Facebook or Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?hl=fr&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;q=theater+improvisation&amp;amp;btnG=&#34;&gt;Even scientific studies begin to show the effectiveness of these tools on collaboration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-we-learn-from-improvisation&#34;&gt;What can we learn from improvisation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques of the theater are the techniques of communicating
&lt;small&gt;Viola Spolin in &amp;ldquo;Improvisation for the theater.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as your work (or life) involves communicating with another human being, there are theater techniques and games to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;listening-and-building&#34;&gt;Listening and Building&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time I am the first to go on stage in an improvised play, I&amp;rsquo;m scared. When you start your scene, not knowing where the story is going, not knowing if your teammates and the audience will react positively to your offer, you only wish for one thing: &lt;em&gt;to never have gotten on the stage in the first place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any person proposing something to a team is the same, the idea is still new and needs protection. Improvisers have created the mantra &lt;em&gt;yes, and&lt;/em&gt; to protect (saying &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;) and build on these new ideas (&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;em&gt;yes, and&lt;/em&gt;, is not just about being nice to a proposition out of kindness. It&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;strong&gt;being the best follower that has ever existed&lt;/strong&gt;, to make everything you can to make that idea work, to &lt;strong&gt;make your partner look beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;. So, if it fails, &lt;em&gt;it won&amp;rsquo;t be the mistake of anyone, it will be the learning for everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the kernel of a movie idea or a fledgling internship program, the new needs protection. Business-as-usual does not. Managers do not need to work hard to protect established ideas or ways of doing business. The system is tilted to favor the incumbent. The challenger needs support to find its footing. And protection of the new-of the future, not the past must be a conscious effort.
&lt;small&gt;Ed. Catmull, president of Pixar in &amp;ldquo;Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trust&#34;&gt;Trust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://appliedimprovisation.network/events/2018-paris/&#34;&gt;2018 Applied Improvisation Network Conference in Paris&lt;/a&gt;. As we were discussing how to enable a group to be better at problem-solving, a theater director shared his surprise :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theater it can take years of work for building trust in a group before we even start to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard part of an improviser&amp;rsquo;s work is to build trust in a group. And this is firmly connected to how the group reacts to mistakes. Education systems everywhere in the world are formed by the same idea of giving feedback when we are wrong. Most of us have grown up in a culture where we felt ashamed to make mistakes. Instead, improvisers learn to embrace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing mistakes is not only being ok with each error. It is also making mistakes as part of the learning process. Improvisers learn to have a positive reaction to errors, to make fun of them, to even build on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night I was operating lights for the show Theatersports. It was my first time in the booth and I was taking everything very seriously, making sure I knew the correct sequences and controls. I was terrified of making a mistake, destroying the show and letting everyone down. Keith came into the lighting booth, casually looking around, asking, &amp;ldquo;Is this your first time doing lights?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; I replied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah&amp;rdquo;, he said. &amp;ldquo;You need to make at least 3 mistakes or you haven&amp;rsquo;t done your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he left the booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the whole show I was looking for any opportunity to take risks so that I could make my quota of mistakes. At the end of the show he said, &amp;ldquo;Patti, you made 2 mistakes  try again next time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith used the logic of success to get me to make mistakes. He relieved me of the stress of fear of failure by giving me permission to make mistakes. He created an environment where I could take risk and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Patti Stiles in &amp;ldquo;The art of making mistakes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;freedom-and-constraints&#34;&gt;Freedom and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask friends to describe how they see improvisation they always tell me that &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s the liberating activity of doing whatever you want on stage and make fun of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; If this were true, the Showstoppers&amp;rsquo; show would be a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to an improv show, they may ask you for a suggestion, describe the ground rules, ask you to define some precise elements of the drama (the place, the characters jobs, their secret desires, etc.). It&amp;rsquo;s because improvisers also know that creation and collaboration are only possible under constraints. In a business environment, maintaining the equilibrium between freedom and constraints is difficult but indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the organization, must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader acts as an &amp;ldquo;Eyes-On, Hands-Off&amp;rdquo; enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem in which the organization operates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Stanley McChrystal from the U.S. Forces Afghanistan in &amp;ldquo;Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;storytelling&#34;&gt;Storytelling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no gods, no nations, no money and no human rights, except in our collective imagination.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;small&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of storytelling in organizations is not a new idea. A lot of books have explored how to build a compelling story. Even some events like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com&#34;&gt;TED talks&lt;/a&gt; have mastered the formula to the point that it&amp;rsquo;s always efficient&amp;hellip; but tend to be predictible as we all now see the recurring pattern. If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure of the pattern you can watch this TEDx Video about&amp;hellip; nothing but using all the TED communications rules to make it attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8S0FDjFBj8o&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is much more than telling a personal anecdote in the middle of a red circle. Improvisers work on building the unique story that this group, this audience, at this moment needs instead of following scripted tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories, and relationship that, taken together, account for a customer&amp;rsquo;s decision to choose one product or service over another
&lt;small&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-comes-next&#34;&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning with the tools of Improvisational theater is a journey. There is no shortcut because it&amp;rsquo;s about being more self-aware of your habits and your surrounding. And then, you can decide, by yourself, the kind of person you want to be with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not yet convinced and want more examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.fr/Applied-Improvisation-Leading-Collaborating-Creating/dp/1350014362/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1536582058&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=applied+improvisation&#34;&gt;Applied Improvisation: Leading, Collaborating, and creating beyond the theater&lt;/a&gt; for more examples of the application of theater techniques outside of the theater and their outstanding results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are convinced, and you want to start using these tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best advice is to find some improv training or workshops near your home to discover the process of improv training. If you prefer to read, you can check out the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.fr/Training-Imagine-Improvisational-Techniques-Creativity-ebook/dp/B015YFJ8GC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1536582204&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=training+to+imagine&#34;&gt;Training to imagine&lt;/a&gt; to get a guided help on how to start applying improvisation in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too long, didn&amp;rsquo;t read! Just watched the Showstoppers video, they are fantastic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This other video is for you. Here is an example of the kind of improv training that makes the Showstoppers so amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>

&lt;p&gt;Here are five great books about creativity. These are very good books where you can experience different aspect of creativity: How it became a culture in a creative company like Pixar (Creativity Inc), how one person can fight to maintain it in a huge industry (Orbiting the Giant Hairball), the importance of mistakes in the creative process (The Art of Making Mistakes), how an author can make crazy idea with everyday things (H2G2) and finally in the best example of Art&amp;amp;Science I know, magic (Magical Mathematics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://theworldasastage.com/img/book-creativity.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:200px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Catmull, a co-founder of Pixar Studios, tell in this book how he worked with his team to build and maintain a creative culture in this incredible company. He also explains how, when bought by Pixar, he helped to make Disney Animation Studio creative again while keeping their personality and not becoming another Pixar. This book is unique because it talks about creativity in an industry with high technical constraints. When Pixar created Toy Story, it was the first 3D animated movie, and most of their first movies were a cutting-edge technology developed to tell new and compelling stories. Also, as most of the books when you learn about the creativity of a company, Catmull detail a lot how his behavior and the behavior of his teams were the keys to a creative mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better. The takeaway here is worth repeating: Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right.
&lt;small&gt;Catmull, Ed. Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is the other side of the creativity spectrum in businesses. Gordon McKenzie worked at Hallmark Cards for 30 years. At one point, as he can tell, nobody knew what exactly his job was, so he took the title &lt;em&gt;creative paradox&lt;/em&gt; and started receiving calls from an employee about new ideas to have a sort of agreement. He always said &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. This beautiful, messy and original book tells the story of a creative mind orbiting around the giant hairball that was becoming more and more his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As every book about creativity will tell, mistakes are at the heart of inspiration, that why we are not comfortable with it. This book is a compilation of 13 essays on mistakes, on how theater people deal with them and include them in their life. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a better way of approaching the subject: by having 13 voices, we learn about mistakes with very different points of views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh my God, it&amp;rsquo;s my turn.
The lights up and they point straight at me.
Everybody is watching me.
I&amp;rsquo;m being blinded; I feel dizzy, sweaty; my shoulders are tensing up;
I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a lump in my throat, thirsty; my mouth is drying up; my heart is pounding, hands are shaking;
I&amp;rsquo;m feeling out of breath; I can&amp;rsquo;t breathe&amp;hellip;
How do I get out?
Can I still cancel the whole thing?
What was I supposed to say? What if I&amp;rsquo;m not funny?
What if I say something wrong?
What if nobody likes me?
What if I fall, mess up?
&lt;small&gt;Marianna Räsänen in The Art of Making Mistakes&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably already know this title as it&amp;rsquo;s the famous Science Fiction trilogy in five books by Douglas Adams. This book is on this list because it&amp;rsquo;s for me a perfect example of creativity. It&amp;rsquo;s not the invention of a whole new world as can be some fantasy or science fiction books. It&amp;rsquo;s the crazy mind of Douglas Adams taking a look on our society, his authentic look. The quote below is one of my favorite examples. A lot of Science Fiction books imagine crazy technology to makes ships invisible, Douglas Adams didn&amp;rsquo;t, he just took an everyday event we all experienced where our things became invisible and applied it to a spaceship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Somebody Else&amp;rsquo;s Problem field is much simpler and more effective, and what&amp;rsquo;s more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people&amp;rsquo;s natural disposition not to see anything they don&amp;rsquo;t want to, weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting, or can&amp;rsquo;t explain.
&lt;small&gt;Douglas Adams in Life, the Universe and Everything (H2G2 #3)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish a math book but don&amp;rsquo;t run away, it&amp;rsquo;s also a magic book. Persi Diaconis is a Statistician and a Magician. This book presents the math behind some magic tricks. It is an excellent example of creativity because this type of magic is a perfect mix of art and science. You discover a mathematical theorem, how to create a story around to make it a fantastic trick. Many magic tricks are based on the same theorems but feel different. With this book, you discover that you can change your view to make a boring mathematical theorem become the most impressive magic you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong; this is a book with a lot of math if you only want to learn magic tricks, pick another one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems in juggling is that gravity is inconveniently strong on the Earth. It has been estimated that a seven-ball juggler on the Earth could juggle forty-one balls on the moon (which has gravity one-sixth as strong as the Earth), except for certain practical difficulties, such as being in a spacesuit and the fact that the pattern doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;scale,&amp;rdquo; i.e., if you throw a forty-one-ball pattern forty feet up, you have to be very accurate since the spread between your two hands is still only (at most) six feet.

        <description>

&lt;p&gt;As a Chief Technical Officer, I see my job as trying to notice as fast as possible our new mistakes and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in an unknown environment with new technologies, avoiding mistakes is impossible. We do mistakes, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything fails all the time.
&lt;small&gt;Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon Web Services&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in this environment, we can be sometimes scared to try something new because of the fear of failure, this is a human reflex that probably helped our ancestor to survive while dangerous animals ate more risky individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I found the book &amp;ldquo;The art of making mistakes&amp;rdquo; with 13 short essays on mistakes by improviser or theater people, I could not wait to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;patti-stiles-and-mistakes-as-a-learning-process&#34;&gt;Patti Stiles and mistakes as a learning process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patti Stiles is one of the most incredible improvisation teachers I&amp;rsquo;ve met so far. Even if you improvised before and she is flying from Australia in your region, book a place, you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes the introduction to this book. She shares how Keith Johnstone, since the first day, permitted her to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night I was operating lights for the show Theatersports. It was my first time in the booth and I was taking everything very seriously, making sure I knew the correct sequences and controls. I was terrified of making a mistake, destroying the show and letting everyone down. Keith came into the lighting booth, casually looking around, asking, &amp;ldquo;Is this your first time doing lights?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; I replied
&amp;ldquo;Ah&amp;rdquo;, he said. &amp;ldquo;You need to make at least 3 mistakes or you haven&amp;rsquo;t done your job.
Then he left the booth.
For the whole show I was looking for any opportunity to take risks so that I could make my quota of mistakes. At the end of the show he said, &amp;ldquo;Patti, you made 2 mistakes  try again next time.&amp;rdquo;
Keith used the logic of success to get me to make mistakes. He relieved me of the stress of fear of failure by giving me permission to make mistakes. He created an environment where I could take risk and learn.
&lt;small&gt;Patti Stiles&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach was very different from everything she experienced at school (and that you probably experienced too). We are so used to give negative feedback that we don&amp;rsquo;t even notice it anymore. In some countries it has also become a way of providing some respect, Frenchs uses the expression &amp;ldquo;Qui aime bien chatie bien&amp;rdquo; (literally who likes you, criticizes you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Patti Stiles Loose Moose improvisation education as she describes it, mistakes were not only tolerated, it was considered as an indispensable need of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paolo-busi-on-diversity-and-difference&#34;&gt;Paolo Busi on diversity and difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paolo Busi is an italian actor and director. He created Impromask, an improvised mask show with Commedia Dell&amp;rsquo;Arte influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, my first task is to suspend judgment. As an improv teacher, the second one is to help the students suspend judgment on themselves
&lt;small&gt;Paolo Busi&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paolo Busi insists on how &lt;em&gt;tolerate diversity and originality&lt;/em&gt; is different from &lt;em&gt;accepting differences and uniqueness of every individuals&lt;/em&gt;. For Paolo Busi, in a &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; environent, we judge others: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;He is original, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow the rules&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. In a &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; environment we suspend judgment&amp;rdquo;_ His ideas are different from mine, what can I learn?_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake appear when I judge some action — mine or someone else’s — as wrong. As long as I can reframe the situation, to integrate what is happening into what was already there, mistakes do not exist.
&lt;small&gt;Paolo Busi&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspension of judgment is a crucial element of communication and creativity. Also, as soon you accept that a mistake does not exist before judgment, a full room of possibilities appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of improvisation with the same group, I thought I was a good improviser. However, when, at an audition, I had to improvise with a beginner, I was shocked at how helpless I was when the improviser does not share the same set of &lt;em&gt;good practices&lt;/em&gt;. They were making a lot of &lt;em&gt;mistakes&lt;/em&gt; which blocked me to push the story forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene is at the market, we are selling fruits next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;ldquo;We had more people last week, I wonder where they all are?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her: &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most natural path is to think that this answer is a mistake: We are selling fruits next to each other, I talk to her as if we knew each other and had this casual discussion of the number of people, her answer does not have a direct connexion to what I said&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, she this is her offer, and it&amp;rsquo;s improvisation, you can&amp;rsquo;t be a good improviser if you only react well each time everything happens as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if it was not a mistake? What can explain that she can&amp;rsquo;t recognize me? Maybe she had an accident and lost her memory. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the twin brother of my friend. Perhaps I have a memory problem, and I think I know this person, Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m a  compulsive seducer and that is my catchphrase. Perhaps nobody was in the market because of an alien invasion yesterday, and every human but me is parasitized by an alien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by considering that this &lt;em&gt;mistake&lt;/em&gt; was an &lt;em&gt;offer&lt;/em&gt;, an endless number of possibilities develop. And they seem way more intriging than the initial casual discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;anna-lena-østern-and-the-self-judgment&#34;&gt;Anna-Lena Østern and the self-judgment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna-Lena Østern is one of the pioneers of drama education in Finland. She shares in this book personal thoughts and feelings about mistakes and our love-hate relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the mistakes I can recall, though, have a feeling of shame attached to them. Something connected to not being observant enough, not being understanding enough, and sometimes being too naive, or not being authentic or true to myself, not listening to my gut feeling, or simply trying to be something I am not in order to please.
&lt;small&gt;Anna-Lena Østern&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more and learn about mistakes, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://draamatyo.fi/tuote/the-art-of-making-mistakes/&#34;&gt;grabbing this book&lt;/a&gt;. All the texts are unique and give a new point of view on this very particular subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 excellent books about acting. More than being only to learn how to acts, these books explore human behaviors and how to bring these behaviors on stage. Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t perform, since &lt;a href=&#34;https://theworldasastage.com/team-collaboration-is-hard-improvisation-training-can-help/&#34;&gt;improvisation is anywhere there is human communication&lt;/a&gt; you would be surprised how much you can learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;audition-everything-an-actor-needs-to-know-to-get-the-part-https-www-goodreads-com-book-show-787895-audition&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/787895.Audition&#34;&gt;Audition: Everything an Actor Needs to Know to Get the Part&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://theworldasastage.com/img/book-audition.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:200px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Shurtleff has been casting director for Broadway, and this is his book on advice on how to succeed at an audition. I was surprised when I first read it how most of his advice goes way beyond the theater world. They are useful for improv of course but also to understand and be more present in our day to day relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;allow anything to be possible ; make choices that give you the maximum possible involvement . If there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility , however unlikely , however remote , that you might love the other character in the scene , say yes to the possibility . There&amp;rsquo;s more feeling in potential love than there is in the impossibility of it . Feeling is what an actor is looking for ; why not pick the most ?
&lt;small&gt;Shurtleff, Michael. Audition: Everything an Actor Needs to Know to Get the Part&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;respect-for-acting-https-www-goodreads-com-book-show-140502-respect-for-acting&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140502.Respect_for_Acting&#34;&gt;Respect for Acting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://theworldasastage.com/img/book-respect-for-acting.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:200px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uta Hagen is a well-known actress. Her book has a strong connexion with Audition, but it&amp;rsquo;s written from the point of view of an actress instead of a director. She gives much valuable advice on how to be more present on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuing job of learning to find out who you really are, of learning to pinpoint your responses and even more important, the myriad, consequent behaviorisms which result will help you begin to fill your warehouse with sources upon which to draw for the construction of a character (the new you selected for your character on stage).
&lt;small&gt;Uta Hagen, Respect for Acting&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-great-acting-teachers-and-their-methods-https-www-goodreads-com-book-show-237165-the-great-acting-teachers-and-their-methods-career-development-series&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237165.The_Great_Acting_Teachers_and_Their_Methods_Career_Development_Series_&#34;&gt;The Great Acting Teachers and Their Methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book introduces several great acting teachers and describes their methods and their influence on the history of acting. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to understand better modern acting as all these teachers have influenced it. It&amp;rsquo;s also a fantastic way to find very different approaches on the job of acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of acting has not taught the world to lie . People have done so since the beginning of time . And if acting in a play is lying , then we simply do not see that lie as destructive . Rather , we regard that lie as Picasso defined all of art , as &amp;ldquo;the lie that reveals a deeper truth .&amp;rdquo;
&lt;small&gt;Brestoff, Richard. Great Acting Teachers and Their Methods&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriental and Western theater have influenced Yoshi Oida. This book has a very different tone than most American inspired acting books. Instead of trying to describe a method, he presents his way of acting as an example and proposes to learn by experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true teacher never explains, never gives out recipes. He - or sometimes she - is a living example of what is possible, of what can be achieved with endless patience and unshakeable determination.
&lt;small&gt;Yoishi Oida - An Actor&amp;rsquo;s Tricks (Performance Books)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last book is not an acting book. Stephen Nachmanovitch writes about the creative process. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken my time to read this book since each chapter is an opportunity to think about one aspect of creativity. Also, as an improviser, spontaneous creation is part of the process, so this book is not far from acting. Just give it a try, chapter by chapter, it&amp;rsquo;s worth the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disappear and become a carrier wave, a vehicle for the music that plays us. The power of creative spontaneity develops into an explosion that liberates us from outmoded frames of reference and from memory that is clogged with old facts and old feelings. Addiction, procrastination, and fear are blown away by this carrier wave, and our music becomes a message about big Self .

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday lunch, you were eating your usual sandwich with this fantastic ham and cheese. You were so &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; eating this meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each movement we could feel that you were enjoying it. Sometimes a simple sandwich can evoke a smile. Your co-workers around the table were not paying any particular attention to you but were unconsciously affected by you: their posture was influenced by the dirty plastic bag you left on the middle of the table and by the gestures you make when you eat. Some days you start a discussion over lunch. Some other days like yesterday, it&amp;rsquo;s with the eyes that the silent communication takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scene is banal, this scene is boring, this scene is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a stage and an audience and anyone of us will start doing some strange things. We&amp;rsquo;ll start exaggerating our movements to make this &lt;em&gt;sandwich eating&lt;/em&gt; more interesting. Others around the table will overreact to each bite you take as if just being normal was not enough. And the public will be bored, not because the scene is necessarily boring but because suddenly, with the presence of the stage, some actors have decided to &lt;strong&gt;play&lt;/strong&gt; the scene instead of &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;fr&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;und&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/gCd8FTeyNU&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gCd8FTeyNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dark Stock Photos (@darkstockphotos) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/darkstockphotos/status/920316418830282752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;17 octobre 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-theater&#34;&gt;What is Theater&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one paradox of theater. We want to tell real life stories but by adding a stage and an audience, the moment and the truth disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So you need to start over to learn how to act&lt;/em&gt;, how to be influenced by the other actors and how to have emotions. We train to be able to reproduce in front of an audience an everyday scene like eating a sandwich, a simple act that every one of us manages to do when we are involved. This is what we call being an actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So you need to start over to learn how to move in space&lt;/em&gt;, how to move your body, how to place yourself in your environment and how to orchestrate the actors, space and movement to reproduce something we can believe in. This is what we call being a director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So you need to start over to learn how to tell a story&lt;/em&gt;, capture what is interesting, what is true and what is meaningful. Just being able to express and maintain emotions, to follow characters and to make this particular moment important. This is what we call being a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what an improviser is trying to do in real time: being an actor, a director and a writer as the scene is being created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-humble-improviser&#34;&gt;The humble improviser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to do a one week intensive improv workshop with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.againproductions.fr/&#34;&gt;Again! Production&lt;/a&gt; in summer 2017 after doing improv for around 10 years. I think the most surprising aspect of this workshop was to admit to myself what seems obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improvisation is hard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first idea you meet in improv is &amp;ldquo;Yes, and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; which mean we should accept as much as we can, we should be positive and  we should avoid our negative habits when playing with others. Too often, these essential ideas are replaced by the idea that improvisational theater is the place where you can do whatever you want&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; without any care of if you are actually playing truthfully or if you are just the next stereotypical elderly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; without any care of if you actually recreate a scene worth remembering or if you are just two players standing in the middle of the stage,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; without any care of if you are actually writing a beautiful story and not looking for the best jokes combo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop reminded me that this essential concept was not there to hide the most important element: improvising is this crazy art form where during the scene, you are trying to be the theater &lt;strong&gt;director&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;actor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;writer&lt;/strong&gt; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s hard, that&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible, that&amp;rsquo;s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-demanding-improviser&#34;&gt;The demanding improviser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again! Productions&lt;/em&gt; teachers of the workshop, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ianparizot.com/&#34;&gt;Ian Parizot&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;
Emmanuel De Chavigny, have an educational background in theater in addition to their improvisation training and experience. It makes their workshop (and their courses) rigorous and highly demanding. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met another group that sets such high standards in improv as they do. The teachers expect a lot from you and this pushed me further to improve as an improviser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;Again! Productions&lt;/em&gt; vision is that improvisational theater doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be a subculture comparing to classical theater and that a good improv show can bring you just as much emotions, story and beautiful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to attain this you need to accept to fully immerse yourself in improv, &lt;em&gt;to affect and be affected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-everyday-improviser&#34;&gt;The everyday improviser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;Humble &amp;amp; Demanding&lt;/strong&gt; approach is not restrained to the Improv or Theater world. Startups call it the &lt;em&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/em&gt;, they concentrate on a little task in a bigger picture and try to do it as best as they can. What we can learn from the improv world is that you can also apply this approach to communication and to your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again! Production is doing a lot of workshops &amp;amp; shows (even in english!) that you can find on their website : &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.againproductions.fr&#34;&gt;https://www.againproductions.fr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never done Improv (go find a workshop!), you can read &amp;ldquo;Impro&amp;rdquo; by Keith Johnstone as an introduction to it and its links with life in general.&lt;/li&gt;
